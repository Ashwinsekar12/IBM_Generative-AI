**Poetry Generation using Deep Learning RNN Algorithm**

---

**Introduction:**

This README provides an overview and guidance on how to utilize the Poetry Generation model developed using Deep Learning Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm. This model is trained to generate poetry-like text based on input data provided during the training phase.

**Model Overview:**

The Poetry Generation model is built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, specifically designed to learn patterns, styles, and structures from a corpus of poetry data. The model employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to capture long-range dependencies in the text data, which are essential for generating coherent and contextually relevant poetry.

**How to Use:**

1. **Setup Environment:**
    - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    - Install necessary libraries by running:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

2. **Training:**
    - Prepare your training data in a text format. Each line in the text file should represent a single poem or a fragment of a poem.
    - Adjust the hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM/GRU layers, hidden units, learning rate, etc., in the model configuration file (`config.py`) based on your requirements.
    - Run the training script:
        ```
        python train.py --data_path <path_to_training_data_file>
        ```
    - The model will start training on the provided data. You can monitor the training progress through the console logs.

3. **Generation:**
    - After training, you can generate poetry by running the generation script:
        ```
        python generate.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --seed_text <seed_text_for_generation>
        ```
    - Replace `<path_to_trained_model>` with the path where your trained model is saved, and `<seed_text_for_generation>` with the initial text prompt from which the model will start generating poetry.
    - The model will generate poetry based on the provided seed text.

**Customization:**

- You can experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training data to achieve poetry generation tailored to your preferences.
- Additionally, you can fine-tune the model on specific poets or poetry genres to capture their unique styles.

**Note:**

- Ensure that your training data is diverse and representative of the kind of poetry you want the model to generate.
- The quality of generated poetry heavily depends on the quality and quantity of training data, as well as the model's architecture and hyperparameters.
